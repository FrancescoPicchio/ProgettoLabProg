A simple c++ project simulating transactions between accounts owned by various users.  
It uses .csv files to store the data of the user, their accounts and the transactions.

### ATTENTION:  
There will be csv files in the directory with the code, but they're different from the ones in the 
that are used by the .exe (which is in the cmake-build-debug folder).
