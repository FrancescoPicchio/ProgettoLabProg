A simple c++ project simulating transactions between accounts owned by various users.  
It uses .csv files to store the data of the user, their accounts and the transactions.

### ATTENTION:  
There will be csv files in the directory with the code, but they're different from the ones in the 
that are used by the .exe (which is in the cmake-build-debug folder). The csv files in the directory
with the code were made for debugging purposes, you can use them for your own data to test, 
but if you run this in an ide like CLion you can just change the context and have it use the directory
with the  code.
